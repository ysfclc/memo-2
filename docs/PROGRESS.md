# Memo — Lead's running notes

Chronological notes kept by the lead while building. They cover what the user asked, what was decided, what each agent delivered, how it was verified, and what is still open. They complement `BUILD_PLAN.md` (what to build), `FEATURES.md` (the checklist) and `ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (formal decisions D-###). Newest entries are at the bottom.

## 2026-10-26

### Session start
- User: the app didn't compile and only two screens showed; finish the product from `reference/`; pull GitHub first; produce a clean APK.
- Found: the live repo is `ysfclc/memo-2` and the local clone was behind. Pulled to b8c6ebd.
- Built the app layer (runtime, planner, model store, 6 screens), merged as PR #2. CI green, APK `memo-apk`.
- User: local AI download should be one click, with discovery. Done in `ModelStore` (pinned Qwen3 × 3, SHA-verified, resume, import, scan).

### Full-product plan
- User: build everything, use subagents, plan properly.
  - Then: the reference apps are poor implementations; architect from first principles.
  - Haiku implementers, small steps, the lead verifies everything.
- Plan committed as `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` (PR #3). Requirements added since, in the order the user asked:
  - §2a automation spec: in-app only, agent loop, action envelope, emulator tests (PR #4)
  - §2b headless in-Memo web runtime (the Fieldwork pattern) plus the floating console (PRs #5, #6)
  - §2c native device apps (the SynthOS Runtime pattern, in `reference/app-release.zip`)
  - §2d human-like actions (anti-ban)
  - §2e full CRUD everywhere, workflow editor, autonomy levels, complete settings
  - §2f "Hey Memo" wake with the screen off
  - §2g tool-using local agent + media engine (local image gen via MediaPipe; carousel; video)
  - §2h English / Polish / Turkish everywhere
  - §2i motion language + performance (release build, baseline profiles)
  - §2j reminders/timers/alarms + notifications, capture/share, sources/search/memory, Today, council modes, API opt-in, onboarding, in-app updates
  - §2k Capability Compiler (the user's "stitch the competence on demand" idea)
  - §2l Self Model from website/LinkedIn/CVs, plus Artifact Studio (tailored CVs, fabrication guard)
  - §2m Teach & Select: web/app element pickers, schema builder, Show Memo recorder, self-healing versioned schemas
- User asked for a sanity check and a separate checklist. Created `docs/FEATURES.md` with a reference cross-check table (§R).

### M0 — Foundation (branch `milestone/M0`)
| Task | Result | Lead verification |
|---|---|---|
| M0.A1 async engine (`Attempt.Pending`, `deliverExternal`) + audit wiring | merged | Read the full engine diff: shared settlement path, gate re-check on delivery, pending side effect → NEEDS_REVIEW after a crash |
| M0.A3 domain v2 entities | merged after rework | Sent back once: `useCount` bumped template versions on reuse. Removed from the entity |
| M0.B1 llama.cpp b11460 + sherpa-onnx 1.13.8 + deps | merged | Hashes pinned and the AAR fails closed. **Lead fix:** native code forced to Release (debug llama.cpp would be unusably slow; APK 209 MB → 75 MB) |
| M0.A8 repair of 7 hidden core test failures | merged | Discovered that CI never ran `:core:test`, and added it. Reviewed each fix: retry key missing from the parser, HardFail skipping branch rescue, provider id case, one wrong test assertion |
| M0.A5 ActionPolicy (en/pl/tr/de/es/fr) + ChannelSwitches | merged | Folding handles İ/ı, ł, ß. Polish/Turkish terms need a native-speaker review (open item) |
| M0.A7 core/platform interfaces | merged | No Android or coroutine imports in core |
| M0.C1 Keystore vault | merged | Fails closed on a missing key, atomic writes, rolling backups, recovery reported |
| M0.A4 semver + workspace v2 + first real migration | merged | **Lead fix:** compiled specs had started writing the workspace schema version instead of the DSL one |
| M0.A6 ModelRouter / RateLimiter / ProviderHealth | merged | SYNTHESIZE kept LOCAL_FIRST per §2g |
| M0.C2 runtime onto vault + plaintext migration | running | — |

- milestone/M0 CI was green (run 40374975745) before A4/A6/C1 merged. It will be re-run before the PR to `main`.

### Lessons (process)
- Never `git stash -u` in the main checkout: it moves `.claude/worktrees` (live agent worktrees). Restored immediately; `.claude/` is now in `.gitignore`.
- Branch CI does not prove core tests unless `:core:test` is in the command (fixed).
- Agents branch from `origin/milestone/M0`. Engineering-log merge conflicts are always additive, so keep both sides.

### Local environment
- User wants to run Memo locally and get a phone link.
- Installing a JDK 17 + Android SDK + emulator into `%USERPROFILE%\Android` (no admin rights needed).
- The network is slow (~0.3 MB/s), so the installer is reordered: emulator and system image first, build toolchain after.
- The phone link will be a GitHub pre-release with the APK, once the artifact download completes.

### Open items
- Native-speaker review of the pl/tr policy terms.
- Device checks: every milestone checklist needs the user's phone.
- M0 close: the PR to `main`, then the device checklist for the user.
